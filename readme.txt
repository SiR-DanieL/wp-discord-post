WP Discord Post uses a Discord bot and Webhook URL to write in a channel in a Discord server when a post is published on a blog.

== Description ==

WP Discord Post is a free plugin for WordPress that uses a Discord bot and Webhook URL to write in your desired channel in your Discord server whenever a new post is published on your blog.

You can configure it by going to Settings > WP Discord Post and filling in all the details. The fields are all required. Click on the links “Learn more” in the description of the fields to learn how to get the necessary data.

= Compatible with contact forms =

WP Discord Post is compatible with Contact Form 7, Jetpack Contact Form, and Gravity Forms sending the content of each form to your Discord before it is sent via email as well.

= Compatible with WooCommerce =

WP Discord Post is also compatible with WooCommerce, sending a new message to Discord every time a new order is created on your shop, or when a new product is added to the catalog.

= Compatible with any custom post type =

WP Discord Post supports any post type, with a bit of custom code. If you want to send a message for your custom post type add this code to your **functions.php** file in **wp-content/themes/your-child-theme-name/**:

`
add_action( 'publish_{post_type}', array( WP_Discord_Post::instance()->post, 'send' ), 10, 2 );
`

Make sure to replace `{post_type}` with the slug of the post type that you want to use, for example if you registered a post type `book` you would use:

`
add_action( 'publish_book', array( WP_Discord_Post::instance()->post, 'send' ), 10, 2 );
`

= Privacy Info =

This plugin  sends private user data to Discord. Different data are sent based on what features you use:

* Posts: Author name
* Contact Forms: Any user data collected via the form
* Orders: Customer and order details

Once the data are sent they are under Discord's control and the plugin cannot remove them from their servers.

== Installation ==

Automatic installation is the easiest option as WordPress handles the file transfers itself and you don’t need to leave your web browser. To do an automatic install of WP Discord Post, log in to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to the Plugins menu and click Add New.

In the search field type “WP Discord Post” and click Search Plugins. Once you’ve found the plugin you can view details about it such as the point release, rating and description. Most importantly of course, you can install it by simply clicking “Install Now”.

= Manual installation =

The manual installation method involves downloading this plugin and uploading it to your web-server via your favourite FTP application. The WordPress codex contains [instructions on how to do this here](https://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Manual_Plugin_Installation).

= Updating =

Automatic updates should work like a charm; as always though, ensure you backup your site just in case.
